# Pulumi Starter Kit

Hi everyone, we're giving open source a shot! This package will be slowly populated. For now, it's being published for some of my [substack guide blog posts](https://www.yevelations.com/).

# Requirements

To keep the package light, we've steered away from hard dependencies. You will need @pulumi/pulumi v3.0.0 or higher installed to use this. @pulumi/aws, @pulumi/azure, @pulumi/gcp, and @pulumi/cloudflare are marked as optional but you will need to install them yourself if you plan to use the relevant constructs.
