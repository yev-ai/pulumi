# Pulumi Starter Kit

Hi everyone, we're giving open source a shot! This package will be slowly populated. For now, it's being published for some of my [substack guide blog posts](https://www.yevelations.com/).

# Requirements

To keep the package light, we've steered away from hard dependencies. You will need:

- [@pulumi/pulumi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/pulumi) v3.0.0 or higher installed.
- To use the relevant constructs, you'll also need:
  - [@pulumi/aws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/aws)
  - [@pulumi/azure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/azure)
  - [@pulumi/gcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/gcp)
  - [@pulumi/cloudflare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/cloudflare)
